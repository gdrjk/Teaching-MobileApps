# pa4

For this project, I updated and cleaned up pa3. 

Changes include: Improved UI, changed theme, faster response time and removed inactive buttons.

Tags listed in the in image textviews are no longer de-synced from input. Now input corresponds to what is tagged as in image, and all are listed as in image when finished with input.
