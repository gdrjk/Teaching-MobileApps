# post_pre_calc
I attempted to make a pre/postfix calculator. The purpose was to make my first GUI calculator in Android Studio.

## System Design 
This application runs all android 7+ devices.

## Usage
You may enter any number in decimal notation, by hitting the deliminator key the number moves from the buffer to the display, or by pressing one of four operators: +,-,*,/. The clear key clears the buffer, and the CE clears the buffer and the display. By hitting the = key, the display string is calculated and displayed the result in its place. Make sure to properly format the string for post or prefix notation (toggled by the switch in the upper right corner). Also, a zero as an operand is currently not allowed and results in an answer of zero.
