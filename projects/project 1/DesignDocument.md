# post_pre_calc
I attempted to make a pre/postfix calculator. The purpose was to make my first GUI calculator in Android Studio.

## System Design 
This application should have run on any android device. 

## Usage
This application may or may not have any functionality. Both of my machines I code on at home have completely different fatal errors and will have to have a complete OS reinstall on at least one of them. The intended usage was you should be able to put in any number in decimal notation, by hitting the deliminator key the number would move from the buffer to the display, or it would move to the buffer by pressing one of four operators: +,-,*,/. The clear key would clear the buffer, and the CE would clear the buffer and the display. By hitting the = key, the display string was calculated and displayed the result in its place.
